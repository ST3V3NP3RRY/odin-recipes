        <h1>Easy Spinach Lasagna with Cauliflower Béchamel</h1>
        <img src="../recipes/images/lasagna.jpeg" alt="lasagna" width="500px" height="auto">
        
        <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <p>Making lasagna in a loaf pan is brilliant for a couple of reasons: You get double the crispy edges, and we love having a homemade lasagna that&#8217s a little smaller to cut down on baking time. The full recipe is for two loaves, so you can freeze one for a rainy day.</p>

        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
        <h3>For the cauliflower bechamel:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cauliflower crown</li>
            <li>1 quart vegetable stock</li>
            <li>1 piece Parmesan rind (about 2 to 3 inches long)</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For the lasgana</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, smashed</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon chili flakes</li>
            <li>2 pounds frozen spinach, thawed and squeezed of its excess moisture</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>2 cups marinara sauce (we like Rao&#8217s or this pressure cooker red sauce if we&#8217re making one from scratch)</li>

            <li>1 package gluten-free no-boil lasagna sheets (we like the fresh ones from Cappello&#8217s)</li>

        <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p>First make the cauliflower béchamel. Break the cauliflower into small florets, discarding most of the stems. Add the florets to a saucepan along with the stock, Parmesan rind, and garlic. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer until the cauliflower is <em>extremely</em> soft. Discard the Parmesan rind and, using a slotted spoon, carefully transfer the cooked cauliflower and garlic to a powerful blender. Add the cooking liquid a tablespoon at a time as needed to get your desired consistency. Taste for seasoning and add salt as needed. Set aside.</p></li>
        

            <li><p>Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the smashed garlic and chili flakes. Once fragrant, cook for a couple of minutes, then add the spinach and cook for about 4 minutes, just until all the flavors have come together. Season with a pinch of salt and set aside to cool.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>To assemble the lasagna, get 2 standard loaf pans (1 to have for dinner now and 1 to freeze for later). In the base of each, spread a generous spoonful of marinara. Then add a noodle, then the cauliflower bechamel, then the spinach, then more marinara, then another layer of noodle. Repeat this until you get to the top, finishing with a layer of cauliflower bechamel.</p></li>
            
            <li></p>Bake covered with foil at 375°F for about 30 minutes, then remove the foil, raise the temperature to 425°F, and bake for another 15 to 20 minutes. Let stand for 5 to 10 minutes before cutting into it.</p></li>
        </ol>
